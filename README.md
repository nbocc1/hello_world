Just learning to use github more effectively

I'm a product nerd who has never developed but have been around developers for many years. 
Looking to add to my knowledge and understanding of the work that developers do in order to build the things that have meaning to me!

Managed a first PR but committed incorrectly to the master branch. Running through a second scenario where the commit occurs from the cloned master branch.
